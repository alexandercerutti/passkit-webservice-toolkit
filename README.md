# Passkit WebService Toolkit

Integrate Apple Wallet Web services with ease.

## Architecture

Passkit WebService Toolkit is a set of packages that aim to make it easier to create an Apple-Wallet-Webservice-compliant API.

Each package implements the endpoints defined by Apple in its [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/walletpasses/adding_a_web_service_to_update_passes) for a different framework and makes it easier for them to be used in a Typescript-based project, by keeping an eye on the developer experience and endpoint versioning.

## API Documentation

The API is kept as much as similar as possible among all the packages (except the toolkit).
A page for each integration is available.
