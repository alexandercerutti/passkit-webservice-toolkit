# Passkit WebService Toolkit

## Architecture

Passkit WebService Toolkit is a framework agnostic library that aims to wrap the endpoints defined by Apple in its [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/walletpasses/adding_a_web_service_to_update_passes) in a Typescript developer-friendly interface.

This package purpose is to create a base on which other packages of the same monorepo can be written on and to create external integrations of Apple Wallet Webservices. You can even propose your own integration based on this!

If you are aiming to use an integration, instead, **you can give a look at some third-party integrations, [listed in the parent directory](../)**.

### Installation

```sh
$ npm install passkit-webservice-toolkit
```
